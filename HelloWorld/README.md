# COMP312


HOW TO RUN COMPILE
-On xcode or other programs that run C++. 
-Run the code, it will display “Hello World”

I used SourceTree available for windows and mac (free software) that works as a GUI for git
https://www.sourcetreeapp.com
It clones the repository and allow to upload to the repository

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Code in C++ for reading integers in a text file and print the average of      
the numbers 
This gave a lot of trouble to run!!!!
It is a command line exec file so it should work on all systems
Click on the file with the code and download the file (do not erase anything 
 in it)
and run it
Compile the thing
main.cpp
